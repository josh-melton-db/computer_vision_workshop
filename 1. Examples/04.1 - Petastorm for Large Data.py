# MAGIC
# MAGIC <a href="https://github.com/uber/petastorm" target="_blank">Petastorm</a> enables single machine or distributed training and evaluation of deep learning models from datasets in Apache Parquet format and datasets that are already loaded as Spark DataFrames. It supports ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and PySpark and can be used from pure Python code.

# MAGIC Below, we define training configurations.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Note**: We define a path for Petastorm to store cached data. Petastorm takes data from a Spark DataFrame, checks if it's already cached and persisted in the file system, and caches it if not. Here, we define where the cache path is to provide a directory for the intermediate files later.

# MAGIC ### Preprocessing Data for Petastorm 
# MAGIC Delta tables inherently store data in Parquet columnar format. Petastorm requires row format for transformation or filtering. You can read [Uber's blog post](https://www.uber.com/blog/petastorm/) on how Petastorm is implemented. There are two approaches to carrying out transformations: 
# MAGIC * Upstream Vectorization
# MAGIC * Downstream Vectorization 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Both approaches require us to use Petastorm TransformSpec function, which we will show later.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ####  Approach 1: Upstream Vectorization
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This approach handles as much transformation as possible prior to passing data to Petastorm and TensorFlow. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Benefits of `SparkDatasetConverter` and `make_spark_converter`:
# MAGIC 1. Caches the data if it has not been cached
# MAGIC 2. Automatically converts SparkML vector into 1D arrays. 
# MAGIC     - This removes the need to use SparkML for training ML models, allowing us to use a variety of deep learning frameworks to train models. 

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from petastorm.spark import SparkDatasetConverter, make_spark_converter

def create_petastorm_converters_vec(train_df, cfg, feature_cols, target_col="label"):
    # Set a cache directory for intermediate data storage 
    spark.conf.set(SparkDatasetConverter.PARENT_CACHE_DIR_URL_CONF, cfg.petastorm_cache)
  
    vector_assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")
    
    transformed_df = vector_assembler.transform(train_df).select("features", target_col)
    
    # Below, we repartition the dataframe for efficiency: we'd like the dataframe to be evenly distributed across workers 
    converter_train = make_spark_converter(transformed_df.repartition(cfg.petastorm_workers_count))
    
    return converter_train

# COMMAND ----------

cfg = TrainConfig()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Notice that Petastorm caches the DataFrame in the path with this directory format: `{datetime}-appid-{spark.sparkContext.applicationId}-{uuid4}`. Date time string format is `%Y%m%d%H%M%S` that represents the time of dataframe materialization. 

# COMMAND ----------

converter_train_vec = create_petastorm_converters_vec(train_df, cfg, feature_cols, target_col)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC At this stage, the dataframe has not yet been materialized. It is only materialized when we call `converter_train.make_tf_dataset` later in order to actively feed data to TensorFlow training framework. We can now further define additional preprocessing logic using `TransformSpec`. All the transformations will apply to each row on the Spark thread, which is why we needed to specify `petastorm_workers_count` in our training configurations.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC About `TransformSpec`:
# MAGIC 1. The output shape of `TransformSpec` is not automatically known by Petastorm. Therefore, we need to supply the length of our feature vector in `edit_fields`. 
# MAGIC 2. `selected_fields` indicates the fields to be selected, and the post-transform schema will respect the field order in `selected_fields`. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Refer to [documentation](https://petastorm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html?highlight=transformspec#module-petastorm.transform).

# COMMAND ----------

from petastorm import TransformSpec

tf_spec_vec = TransformSpec(
    edit_fields=[("features", np.float32, (len(feature_cols),), False)], 
    selected_fields=["features", target_col]
)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Gotchas about `epoch`:
# MAGIC - When using `tf.keras.layers.Normalization` (or other preprocessing layers), remember that `.adapt()` is not epoch-aware. This means that we need to have two separate calls of `converter_train.make_tf_dataset` to
# MAGIC   - normalize our data in one go: `num_epochs=1`
# MAGIC   - train the DL model with infinite batches of data: `num_epochs=None`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - The epoch we are referring to is separate from training epochs, which dictates how many times TF sees the entire dataset. Petastorm epoch is the number of times for Petastorm to pass over all rows. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Why `prefetch`?
# MAGIC - It is important for model performance. We are creating a dataset that is always `n` batches ahead, while our model is training on another batch.
# MAGIC - Refer to [tf.keras's documentation here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance#prefetching).
# MAGIC   - When the data is large, we usually prefer to leave to `tf.data.AUTOTUNE` to decide how many batches to prefetch, rather than using trials and errors to set it manually.

# COMMAND ----------

### This `with` statement here creates train_ds in TF dataset format to feed into a TF algorithm. This means that what we supply to TransformSpec will be performed on each batch of data.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Again, note that we use **`num_epochs=None`** to generate infinite batches of data to avoid handling the last incomplete batch. This is particularly useful in the distributed training scenario, where we need to guarantee that the numbers of data records seen on all workers are identical. Given that the length of each data shard may not be identical, setting **`num_epochs`** to any specific number would fail to meet the guarantee.

# MAGIC #### Approach 2: Downstream Vectorization

# MAGIC Here, we use the approach of passing the conversion of feature vector to 1D arrays to Petastorm. While this approach works, we recommend pushing as many data transformations upstream to allow higher efficiency when training.

# MAGIC In addition to specifying the output shape and schema, we instruct Petastorm how to preprocess our data. Here we need to prepare the data to be a 1D array from a vector. Hence, we define `make_transform_row` to perform the transformations.
# MAGIC
